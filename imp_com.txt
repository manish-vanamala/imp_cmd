1)amend --> it used when we have committed some file and later we have realized that we have done some mistakes then we can change and commit with in the same commit
example : 
let we have a file.txt with some typos and we have committed it
then after we realized that we have made mistakes and have'nt pushed to the remote repository then we can use
(git commit --amend)
their we can change the changes and commit it

2)Stash --> It is used to save changes without commiting 

Example :
let we say we are having a file and we have made some changes in that file 
if we use git status we get that file has been modified message 
and we want back the original file and even the changed file 
then we can use (git stash save "message about the work done on the file")
and if we want to retrieve we can use (git stash pop or git stash apply "stash index" and use git stash drop "stash index")


3)squash  --> Replacing a set of commits to a single commit 
(git rebase -i HEAD~3)
it will open up default editor there we have to change pick to squash


4)merge ---> It is used to merge the branch which we have created to other branch. so that we can have all the commits in other branch.


(git merge <branch-name>)

5)merge-conflict --> this is happen when we overide a line in a file which is present in one branch by another branch.

we can resolve it on our wished manner
